# Regex_Tutorial## Description

I wrote this gist tutorial to show the functionality and the use of what regular expressions are.  They can make it easier to find a specific string in our code without spending lots of time going through it line by line.

## Motivation

As programmers theres a lot to remember so I created this gist on regular expressions to help as a reminder and to keep my skills sharp on using them when I need to look through lots of code.

There is nothing to install for this however you can follow these instructions to create your very own gist.  Log into your github account and navigate yo the top right corner where you can see three icons in the header.  click on the center icon with the + symbol on it.  This will enable a drop down menu where you can click on the option New gist.  Once you do that you can scroll down to the bottom and choose to create a secret gist or a public gist.  Once you decide which one you want to create just click the green button at the bottom and thats it.  You now have a brand new gist to write about whatever you need.
